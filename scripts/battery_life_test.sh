# Example usages

## Test battery life down to 20%, prevent idle sleep
# THRESHOLD=20 CAFFEINATE=1 CSV=battlog.csv ./battery_life_test.sh
#
## Prevent idle sleep, run down to 20%, then shutdown
# THRESHOLD=20 CAFFEINATE=1 CMD="shut down" CSV=battlog.csv ./battery_life_test.sh
#
## Run batteryt o death, prevent idle sleep along the way
# CMD=nothing CAFFEINATE=1 CSV=battlog.csv ./battery_life_test.sh
#
## Just log battery life, don't do anything
# CMD=nothing CSV=battlog.csv ./battery_life_test.sh

# Currently a macOS-only script due to dependencies on:
# pmset: for reading most power information
# ioreg: reading voltage
# osascript: running the power control event without requiring sudo for 'shutdown'

# Run this script to automatically sleep or shutdown your system at a defined battery level
# For example if you want to see how long your system lasts playing a video
# on repeat with the screen on, run this, go to bed, wake up and your computer
# will have put itself to sleep and you'll have a log of when that happened!
# This is much better than running the computer until it's dead as that's not
# good for the life of lithium-ion batteries

# At what battery percentage level to trigger an event
# It's advised not to use a value lower than 20 as this stresses lithium-ion
# batteries. Repeatedly running li-ion battery below 20% charge will permanently
# affect their charge capacity
#
# If the computer is plugged in and the battery is below this level, the event
# will NOT be executed.
# E.g. Battery is at 5% but laptop is plugged in, no event fired
#
# Set to -1 to let the system run itself to death. 0 won't necessarily work
# since on old batteries and fouled-up systems, the system can read 0 then jump
# back up

# valid options are: sleep, shut down, restart, and nothing

# How long to wait between battery checks, in seconds

# When set to 1, this script will use caffeinate to prevent the system from
# going to sleep. This is a good alternative to playing a video on a loop
