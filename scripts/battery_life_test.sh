#!/bin/zsh

# this is a macOS-only script because it uses:
# pmset: for reading battery level
# system_profiler: reading battery load
# osascript: running the power control event without requiring sudo for 'shutdown'

# example usage
# ./battery_life_test.sh | tee "battery-test-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M).log"

# Run this script to automatically sleep or shutdown your system at a defined battery level
# For example if you want to see how long your system lasts playing a video
# on repeat with the screen on, run this, go to bed, wake up and your computer
# will have put itself to sleep and you'll have a log of when that happened!
# This is much better than running the computer until it's dead as that's not
# good for the life of lithium-ion batteries

# At what battery percentage level to trigger an event
# It's advised not to use a value lower than 20 as this stresses lithium-ion
# batteries. Repeatedly running li-ion battery below 20% charge will permanently
# affect their charge capacity
EVENT_THRESHOLD=20

# valid options are: sleep, shut down, restart
EVENT_NAME="sleep"
